## About The Project
This is a template you can use to quickly start your full stack next.js project. After bootstrapping the app with create-next-app, I have added the following: 
- a node server
	- hosts the site and can be used for crud operations
- environment variable configuration
	- frontend: env-config.js
	- backend: .env
- next-images
	- allows you to import images
- @zeit/next-css
	- allows you to import css files
